                    The H2 chip powers a more personalized audio experience with the 2nd generation AirPods Pro with Wireless MagSafe Charging Case from Apple.
                    The chip works with a custom-built low-distortion driver, amplifier, and inward-facing mic in each ear to deliver clear highs,
                    powerful bass, and audio tuned to your ear shape as you hear it. They also usher in a new dimension of sound with immersive 
                    Spatial Audio, making you feel like youâ€™re on stage with the band. Other aspects of the AirPods Pro have been upgraded, 
                    including ANC with double the cancellation, a transparency mode that adapts to high decibel sounds, and more. 
                    With all the reengineered features in the AirPods Pro 2nd gen, Apple takes your mobile audio experience to a new, more personal level.
